# Matplotlib in Python for Data Visualization

Two csv files used as data source for analysis: Mouse_metadata.csv and Study_results.csv

Pymaceuticals_Analysis is the jupyter source file to run analysis, which contains a for-loop to perform data iteration after data import, tranform/clean. Subsequently summary statistics, line and scatter plots, bar and pie charts, and correlation and regression analyses were conducted for data visualization using Matplotlib in Python.
