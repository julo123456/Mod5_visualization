# Matplotlib in Python for Data Visualization

## Background
The data was comprised of anti-cancer medications study from a pharmaceutical company. 
The purpose of this analysis is to compare the performance of drug of interests against other treatment regiments. 

### Outcome
Pymaceuticals_Analysis is the jupyter source file to run analysis, which contains a for-loop to perform data iteration after data import, tranform/clean. 
Subsequently summary statistics, line and scatter plots, bar and pie charts, and correlation and regression analyses were conducted for data visualization using Matplotlib in Python.
